#Directions for moving Rubik's Cube

**- IMPORTANT!! Make sure you have the Blender Console (Window > Toggle System Console) open before you run this script!!**  
**- You will notice the screen regenerates on each next turn, but make sure you have it positioned properly in the 3D view before you start!**  
**- X and Y axes will be flipped compared to Blender's axes, but you should disregard Blender's axes and imagine your own based on the 'FRONT'** **  
**- optional parameters (to be entered at the bottom of the script in the Text Editor): *starting frame*, and _frames per turn_**  

**In the Blender Console, enter one of the following:**  

**L , L'**  
**MY , MY'  (controls are from LEFT perspective)**  
**R , R'**  
**----------------**  
**U , U'**  
**MZ , MZ'  (controls are from TOP perspective)**  
**D , D'**  
**----------------**  
**F , F'**  
**MX , MX'  (controls are from FRONT perspective)**  
**B , B'** 

**'NEXT' or 'next' for each next turn (you can have more than one rotation per turn)**  

**Blank (just press enter) to finish animating**
  
** **NOTE: the 'FRONT' is ORANGE**
